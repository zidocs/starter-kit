title: Page Titles and Metadata
description: "Setting the title and metadata for navigation"

## The Basics

Each page is an MDX file that should begin with the following metadata syntax with `---` at the start and end:

```mdx
---
title: [title of the page]
---
```

Other metadata goes in between the same --- lines. For example, this page uses this metadata:

```mdx
---
title: "Page Titles and Metadata"
description: "Metadata is important for API pages optimization"
---
```

## Description

You can show a description that shows directly under the title with the description metadata.

```mdx
description: "Your description goes here."
```
