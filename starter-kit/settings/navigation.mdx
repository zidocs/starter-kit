<Warning>
  Note, folders cannot be named `api` due to NextJS limitations. Please try
  `api-reference` as an alternative.
</Warning>

## Tabs

Tabs help distinguish between different topics or sections of your documentation. They show up above the main sidebar. Example: `Documentation` `Writing Content`

Configure tabs with the `tabs` field of the `zidocs.json` file. The `url` field of the tab object should map to a folder of content added to your sidebar, or an external link.

```json
"tabs": [
    {
        "name": "API References",
        "url": "api-references"
    },
    {
        "name": "Content",
        "url": "content"
    },
    {
        "name": "Blog",
        "url": "https://your-website.com/blog"
    }
]
```

To configure the default `Documentation` primary tab, add the `primaryTab` field to your `zidocs.json` file with your desired name. Any files in your navigation not in a folder reserved by another tab will show up in the primary tab.

```json
"primaryTab": {
    "name": "Home"
}
```

## Sidebar

Our sidebar navigation syntax is recursive which means you can make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<Info>
  Once you add a page to your docs directory, you'll need to add the path to
  `zidocs.json` to add it to the sidebar. Pages do not show up automatically.
</Info>


```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": ["quickstart"]
    }
]
```


### Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `zidocs.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>
  You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside
  another folder. Zidocs uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api`
  folder for internal server calls. We recommend using the folder name
  `api-reference` instead.
</Warning>


```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Group Name",
        "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
    }
]
```
