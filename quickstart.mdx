## Getting Started with Zidocs

Welcome to the Zidocs documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to deploy, update and supercharge your documentation with the advanced features Zidocs offers.

### 1. Deploying Your Docs Repository

Zidocs docs are rendered from MDX files and configurations defined in our starter template.

<Accordion icon="github" title="Creating Your Documentation Repository">
  To create your docs repo, follow these instructions:

  1. Clone our [starter-kit](https://github.com/zidocs/starter-kit) into a new public repo. You can make the repo private later.
  2. Then install zidocs CLI globally in your computer with:
  ```bash
  npm install zidocs --globally
  ```
  3. Finally you can build your documentation with:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  It will show up as .next in your documentation folder.
