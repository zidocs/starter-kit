    Example: `Settings`

    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="pages" type="string[]">

</ResponseField>b:T8dc,---
title: "Navigation"
description: "Organize your docs directory to guide your users to the information they need "
---

<Warning>
  Note, folders cannot be named `api` due to NextJS limitations. Please try
  `api-reference` as an alternative.
</Warning>

## Tabs

Tabs help distinguish between different topics or sections of your documentation. They show up above the main sidebar. Example: `Documentation` `Writing Content`

Configure tabs with the `tabs` field of the `zidocs.json` file. The `url` field of the tab object should map to a folder of content added to your sidebar, or an external link.

```json
"tabs": [
    {
        "name": "API References",
        "url": "api-references"
    },
    {
        "name": "Content",
        "url": "content"
    },
    {
        "name": "Blog",
        "url": "https://your-website.com/blog"
    }
]
```

To configure the default `Documentation` primary tab, add the `primaryTab` field to your `zidocs.json` file with your desired name. Any files in your navigation not in a folder reserved by another tab will show up in the primary tab.

```json
"primaryTab": {
    "name": "Home"
}
```

## Sidebar

Our sidebar navigation syntax is recursive which means you can make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<Info>
  Once you add a page to your docs directory, you'll need to add the path to
  `zidocs.json` to add it to the sidebar. Pages do not show up automatically.
</Info>


```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": ["quickstart"]
    }
]
```


### Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `zidocs.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>
  You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside
  another folder. Zidocs uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api`
  folder for internal server calls. We recommend using the folder name
  `api-reference` instead.
</Warning>


```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Group Name",
        "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
    }
]
```
c:Ta1e,---
title: Headers and Text
description: "Text, title, and styling in standard markdown"
---

## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```mdx
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best use to subsection headers.

```mdx
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of the contents on the right

</Tip>

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**` `_` `~` around text to format it.


| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |


## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

You can validate broken links in your docs with [our CLI](/development).

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```mdx
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```mdx
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### Line Breaks

Add a linebreak. Markdown syntax also recognizes a double enter in your MDX as a linebreak.

```html
<br />
```

```mdx
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2
```d:Td26,---
title: "Images, Videos, and Embeds"

/>

<Info>
  Zidocs supports files up to 5 MB. To use larger files, consider a storage
  service like Cloudinary and embed in your Zidocs documentation.
</Info>

## Image

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images using the following code

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/content/embed) to add images.

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Disable Image Zoom

To disable the default zoom on click for images, add the noZoom property to image embeds.

```html
<img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Linking Images

To link an image, for example to create a button on your docs, encompass the image in a link with the `noZoom` property. Images in `a` tags will automatically have a pointer cursor.

```html
<a href="https://docs.zidocs.com" target="_blank">
  <img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
</a>
```

### Dark Mode

To use separate images for light and dark mode, use Tailwind CSS to hide and show images.

```html
<img className="block h-32 dark:hidden" src="/path/image-light.jpg" />
<img className="hidden h-32 dark:block" src="/path/image-dark.jpg" />
```

## Lists
### Ordered List

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

```

### Unordered List

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

```mdx
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Nested List

Add indents on list items to nest them

- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item

```md

### Creating a table

<Tip>

The Table component follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).

</Tip>

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

```md
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |

## Basic Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks.

```
helloWorld();
```

````md
```
helloWorld();
```
````

## Syntax Highlighting

Put the name of your programming language after the three backticks to get syntax highlighting.


```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

````md
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

## Names

You can add more text after the programming language to set the name of your code example. The text can be anything as long as its all in one line.

```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```

````md Code Block Example
```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";

</ResponseField>15:T8dc,---
title: "Navigation"
description: "Organize your docs directory to guide your users to the information they need "
---

<Warning>
  Note, folders cannot be named `api` due to NextJS limitations. Please try
  `api-reference` as an alternative.
</Warning>

## Tabs

Tabs help distinguish between different topics or sections of your documentation. They show up above the main sidebar. Example: `Documentation` `Writing Content`

Configure tabs with the `tabs` field of the `zidocs.json` file. The `url` field of the tab object should map to a folder of content added to your sidebar, or an external link.

```json
"tabs": [
    {
        "name": "API References",
        "url": "api-references"
    },
    {
        "name": "Content",
        "url": "content"
    },
    {
        "name": "Blog",
        "url": "https://your-website.com/blog"
    }
]
```

To configure the default `Documentation` primary tab, add the `primaryTab` field to your `zidocs.json` file with your desired name. Any files in your navigation not in a folder reserved by another tab will show up in the primary tab.

```json
"primaryTab": {
    "name": "Home"
}
```

## Sidebar

Our sidebar navigation syntax is recursive which means you can make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<Info>
  Once you add a page to your docs directory, you'll need to add the path to
  `zidocs.json` to add it to the sidebar. Pages do not show up automatically.
</Info>


```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": ["quickstart"]
    }
]
```


### Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `zidocs.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>
  You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside
  another folder. Zidocs uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api`
  folder for internal server calls. We recommend using the folder name
  `api-reference` instead.
</Warning>


```json Navigation With Folder
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Group Name",
        "pages": ["your-folder/your-page"]
    }
]
```

title: Headers and Text
description: "Text, title, and styling in standard markdown"
---

## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```mdx
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best use to subsection headers.

```mdx
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of the contents on the right

</Tip>

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**` `_` `~` around text to format it.


| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |


## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

You can validate broken links in your docs with [our CLI](/development).

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```mdx
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```mdx
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### Line Breaks

Add a linebreak. Markdown syntax also recognizes a double enter in your MDX as a linebreak.

```html
<br />
```

```mdx
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2
```17:Td26,---

  src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Everest_North_Face_toward_Base_Camp_Tibet_Luca_Galuzzi_2006.jpg"
/>

<Info>
  Zidocs supports files up to 5 MB. To use larger files, consider a storage
  service like Cloudinary and embed in your Zidocs documentation.
</Info>

## Image

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images using the following code

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/content/embed) to add images.

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Disable Image Zoom

To disable the default zoom on click for images, add the noZoom property to image embeds.

```html
<img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Linking Images

To link an image, for example to create a button on your docs, encompass the image in a link with the `noZoom` property. Images in `a` tags will automatically have a pointer cursor.

```html
<a href="https://docs.zidocs.com" target="_blank">
  <img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
</a>
```

### Dark Mode

To use separate images for light and dark mode, use Tailwind CSS to hide and show images.

```html
<img className="block h-32 dark:hidden" src="/path/image-light.jpg" />
<img className="hidden h-32 dark:block" src="/path/image-dark.jpg" />
```

## Lists
### Ordered List

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

### Unordered List

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

```mdx
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Nested List

Add indents on list items to nest them

- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item

```md
- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item
```

<Tip>

Lists follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1).

### Creating a table

<Tip>

The Table component follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).

</Tip>

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

```md
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |

title: "Code Blocks"
description: "Display code with optional syntax highlighting"
icon: "code"
---

## Basic Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks.

```
helloWorld();
```

````md
```
helloWorld();
```
````

## Syntax Highlighting

Put the name of your programming language after the three backticks to get syntax highlighting.


```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

````md
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

## Names

You can add more text after the programming language to set the name of your code example. The text can be anything as long as its all in one line.

```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```

````md Code Block Example
```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```
````

## Getting Started with Zidocs

Welcome to the Zidocs documentation guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to deploy, update and supercharge your documentation with the advanced features Zidocs offers.

### 1. Deploying Your Docs Repository

Zidocs docs are rendered from MDX files and configurations defined in our starter template.

<Accordion icon="github" title="Creating Your Documentation Repository">
  To create your docs repo, follow these instructions:

  1. Clone our [starter-kit](https://github.com/zidocs/starter-kit) into a new public repo. You can make the repo private later.
  2. Then install zidocs CLI globally in your computer with:
  ```bash
  npm install zidocs --globally
  ```
  3. Finally you can build your documentation with:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  It will show up as .next in your documentation folder.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="cloud" title="Deploying Your Documentation in Vercel">
  To deploy your docs repo in Vercel, follow these instructions:

  1. Added your project to Vercel.
  2. Then go into settings and put these configurations to your project.
    <Image className="rounded-md hidden dark:block" src="https://zidocs-assets.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/settingsvercel.png"/>
    <Image className="rounded-md block dark:hidden" src="https://zidocs-assets.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/settingsvercel-light.png"/>
  3. And run a new deployment.
  4. Congratulations, your app is already deployed! Easy right?
</Accordion>

<Warning>It's in my backlog the creation of an github app to automatically deploy your documentation.</Warning> 

### 2. Updating Your Docs

Zidocs enables you to easily customize the style, structure, and content of your docs.

### All Done!

Congrats! You’ve set up your Zidocs and it’s looking amazing! Need support or want to give some feedback? Open a issue, i will respond asap.

title: "Navigation"
description: "Organize your docs directory to guide your users to the information they need "
---

<Warning>
  Note, folders cannot be named `api` due to NextJS limitations. Please try
  `api-reference` as an alternative.
</Warning>

## Tabs

Tabs help distinguish between different topics or sections of your documentation. They show up above the main sidebar. Example: `Documentation` `Writing Content`

Configure tabs with the `tabs` field of the `zidocs.json` file. The `url` field of the tab object should map to a folder of content added to your sidebar, or an external link.

```json
"tabs": [
    {
        "name": "API References",
        "url": "api-references"
    },
    {
        "name": "Content",
        "url": "content"
    },
    {
        "name": "Blog",
        "url": "https://your-website.com/blog"
    }
]
```

To configure the default `Documentation` primary tab, add the `primaryTab` field to your `zidocs.json` file with your desired name. Any files in your navigation not in a folder reserved by another tab will show up in the primary tab.

```json
"primaryTab": {
    "name": "Home"
}
```

## Sidebar

Our sidebar navigation syntax is recursive which means you can make nested navigation groups. You don't need to include `.mdx` in page names.

<Info>
  Once you add a page to your docs directory, you'll need to add the path to
  `zidocs.json` to add it to the sidebar. Pages do not show up automatically.
</Info>


```json Regular Navigation
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": ["quickstart"]
    }
]
```


### Folders

Simply put your MDX files in folders and update the paths in `zidocs.json`.

For example, to have a page at `https://yoursite.com/your-folder/your-page` you would make a folder called `your-folder` containing an MDX file called `your-page.mdx`.

<Warning>
  You cannot use `api` for the name of a folder unless you nest it inside
  another folder. Zidocs uses Next.js which reserves the top-level `api`
  folder for internal server calls. We recommend using the folder name
  `api-reference` instead.
</Warning>


```json Navigation With Folder

title: Headers and Text
description: "Text, title, and styling in standard markdown"
---

## Titles

Best used for section headers.

```mdx
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Best use to subsection headers.

```mdx
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of the contents on the right

</Tip>

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**` `_` `~` around text to format it.


| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |


## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

You can validate broken links in your docs with [our CLI](/development).

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```mdx
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```mdx
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### Line Breaks

Add a linebreak. Markdown syntax also recognizes a double enter in your MDX as a linebreak.

```html
<br />
```

```mdx
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2

<Info>
  Zidocs supports files up to 5 MB. To use larger files, consider a storage
  service like Cloudinary and embed in your Zidocs documentation.
</Info>

## Image

### Using Markdown

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images using the following code

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/content/embed) to add images.

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Disable Image Zoom

To disable the default zoom on click for images, add the noZoom property to image embeds.

```html
<img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Linking Images

To link an image, for example to create a button on your docs, encompass the image in a link with the `noZoom` property. Images in `a` tags will automatically have a pointer cursor.

```html
<a href="https://docs.zidocs.com" target="_blank">
  <img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
</a>
```

### Dark Mode

To use separate images for light and dark mode, use Tailwind CSS to hide and show images.

```html
<img className="block h-32 dark:hidden" src="/path/image-light.jpg" />
<img className="hidden h-32 dark:block" src="/path/image-dark.jpg" />
```

```

For other videos, use:

```html
<video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="link-to-your-video.com"
></video>
```

To autoplay the video, use:

```html
<video
  autoplay

title: "Lists and Tables"
description: "Display information in lists and tables"
---
## Lists
### Ordered List

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

### Unordered List

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

```mdx
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Nested List

Add indents on list items to nest them

- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item

```md
- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item
```

<Tip>

Lists follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1).

</Tip>

## Tables

| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |


### Creating a table

<Tip>

The Table component follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).

</Tip>

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

```md
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |

title: "Code Blocks"
description: "Display code with optional syntax highlighting"
icon: "code"
---

## Basic Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks.

```
helloWorld();
```

````md
```
helloWorld();
```
````

## Syntax Highlighting

Put the name of your programming language after the three backticks to get syntax highlighting.


```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

````md
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

## Names

You can add more text after the programming language to set the name of your code example. The text can be anything as long as its all in one line.

```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```

````md Code Block Example
```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```
````
